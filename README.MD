Mike's Enhanced Small C Compiler for Z80 and CP/M

Copyright (c) 1999-2021 Miguel Garc√≠a / FloppySoftware

**MESCC** is my project of a **C compiler** for the [CP/M operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) and the Z80 cpu.

**NOTE**: This project has been extracted from my [RetroProjects](https://github.com/MiguelVis/RetroProjects) repository.

Overview
--------

As it is written in MESCC, it can compile itself.

It is based on the version 1.7 (Oct. 1985) of [Small C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-C) by Ron Cain, Mike Bernson's and John Hill.

MESCC outputs **Z80 assembler** code that can be assembled with **ZSM/Z80ASMUK** (supplied with MESCC), in order to build an HEX file.

The HEX file can be converted to an executable COM file with LOAD (supplied with CP/M 2), HEXCOM (supplied with CP/M 3) or **HEXTOCOM** (supplied with MESCC).

Also is supplied **CCOPT**, a peephole optimizer.

I use MESCC for nearly all my software projects.
